This repo contains Java programs that I have written while learning and practicing Java. It includes basic to advanced concepts like operators, loops, methods, arrays, strings, and object-oriented programming (OOP). 
I am sharing these programs on GitHub to track my progress the programs are structured with clear code, comments, and explanations to aid learning and reference.
